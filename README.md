One of the most interesting things I noticed when training the perceptron network is that even with a training set with 100% certainty, the network continues to have a slight 5-8% gravitation towards a nonexistent result. This is akin to zombie stocks that hang around instead of rightfully plunging to zero. There is something intrinsic about the structure of neural networks that embraces outlying possibilities. Some might call this belief.
